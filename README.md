# Grouping Actively Trading Cryptocurrencies
## Utilizing Unsupervised Machine Learning

### Project Overview
An investment bank is interested in offering a cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. They have consulted with us to assist them with creating a portfolio, as they don't fully understand the crypto universe. The goal of this project is to group the cryptocurrencies in order to create a classification system for the new investment portfolio.

Project Flow:
- Data Cleaning / Pre-processing
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Elbow Curve
- Clustering using K Means
- Aggregating/Summarizing data
- Visualizing results with 3D + 2D scatter plots
